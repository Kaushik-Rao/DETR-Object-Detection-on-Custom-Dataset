# DETR-Object-Detection-on-Custom-Dataset
Detection Transformer (DETR), an object detection transformer performs much better than CNN withtin the domain of Computer Vision. DETR directly predicts the final set of detections by combining a common CNN with a transformer architecture. The model has the highest performance with an overall precision of 91.48% and an overall recall of 50.22%.
